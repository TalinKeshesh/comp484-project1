            <h2>Legacy & Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Linkin Park&apos;s legacy comes from how dramatically they expanded what mainstream rock could sound and feel like: by fusing heavy guitars with hip&hyphen;hop rhythms, electronic layers, and pop hooks, they helped normalize genre&hyphen;blending on rock radio and set a modern template for songwriting and production that countless later alt&hyphen;rock and metalcore bands built on. Their breakthrough era, especially Hybrid Theory, became a generational standard, while the band&apos;s emotionally direct lyrics about anger, anxiety, and self&hyphen;doubt created a rare sense of identification for fans and made their music feel like a safe outlet for people navigating mental health struggles. Even years later, their influence remains visible in the structure and sound of contemporary rock, and their story continues to stay culturally relevant through ongoing releases, touring, and a fan community that has kept the music alive across multiple internet generations.

            <h2>My Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                I&apos;ve been listening to Linkin Park for a long time. For me, it&apos;s never been about the biggest hits. These days I&apos;ll even skip songs like &quot;In the End&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot; because I&apos;ve heard them so many times. What keeps me coming back is the feeling their music creates. There&apos;s something about rock that hits differently, and it&apos;s only amplified live.

            <p>
                In the middle of a massive crowd, it somehow feels <q>like home</q>, like you&apos;ve found another family. People are friendly, nobody&apos;s judging, and you can just be yourself and get completely lost in the sound. I&apos;ve been to three concerts so far, and I know there will be many more. The music is powerful, and the energy is unmatched, especially when you&apos;re right up front, standing at the edge of the stage.
